There are two methods by which we can organize the files


Method I-

By using command

cmake -H. -B <subdirectoryname>
 
-H.-->current directory
-Bâ†’to build the sub directory in root folder




Method II-

By adding command in the CMakeLists.txt
set(CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin)
Where binary file output is stored in an directory

bash

Vi CMakeLists.txt

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.9.1)
project(hello)
set(CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/<subdirectoryname>)
add_executable(executable main.c)
